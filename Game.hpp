public:
 Game(); //DONE
// This constructor asks for user input (cin) to determine the size of the gameboard, the number of
// and the number of players who are computers (automated). It then sets the size, numplayers, and
// compplayers and calls the makeBoard method to create the board, calls the getPlayers function to
// create an array of pointers to Player objects, sets turn to 0 (for the index of teh current player's
// turn), and sets won to be false.
 Game(bool);
// This constructor takes as input a boolean value indicating whether the game is completely automated
// or not. If the game is automated (true boolean value), the numplayers and the compplayers are both
// set to 2 (meaning that there are 2 players, and they're both automatic, not human). The board is
// matrix is created as a random square size between 3 and 11 and calling makeBoard()), turn is set
// to 0 (the first player), won is set to false, and the getPlayers function is called to create an array
// of pointers to Player objects.
// If the game is not automated (boolean value is false), the Game() constructor is called.
// This constructor is awesome for testing and for working on Artificial Intelligence.
 void makeBoard();
// Creates the board to be a matrix of size x size chars, and fills each cell in the matrix with a '.';
 void printBoard();
// Prints the board, with each character in a row printed out, separated by a tab ('\t').
// Right after the makeBoard() method is called, the board should be sizexsize .'s
// e.g.,
// . . . . .
// . . . . .
// . . . . .
// . . . . .

 void getPlayers();
// This method sets up the dynamically created array of Players (players array).
// I did this by including an array of names that was as long as the maximum number of players I could have in the
// game, and an equally long array of characters for those players.
// This function then dynamically allocated an array of players, and for each computer player (compplayers) it
// created a new player object with a name from the name array and a character from the character array. It then
// initialized each human player by asking (cout) for the player’s name and reading it in (cin) and then asking for the
// player’s character and reading that in, and then creating a new player for the player array.
 void printPlayers();
// This method's sole purpose was to make sure that initializing array of pointers to Players worked
// You may choose not to implement it - but then you need to be confident that your getPlayers() method worked.
 void playGame();
// This method is called from the Game() constructors last - it is what starts the playing of the game, and it
// continues until the board is full (there are no '.' characters left on the board and boardFull is false.
// While the board loops, it calls the findMoves method to find the next move a player in the game is going to make.
//It then calls the checkWin() method to determine who won and prints out
// the winner (Note that this method prints out the board after each player's turn, as well as each player's score
// so far, so you can watch the game progress).

void findMoves(Player *p);
// Regular version, this method continues to generate random x,y values until that cell on the
// board is empty, then places the player's character v on the board, and checks to see if a
// square is completed using checkFour. If so, true is returned and that player’s score goes up by 1 in the
// playGame method, and that player gets to take another turn (so turn does not increase by 1). Otherwise turn
// increases so that it becomes the next player’s turn (turn must loop back to 0 when it gets to be >= numPlayers)

// movesList *findMoves(char v);
 //Extra Credit Version of findMoves:
 //This method dynamically creates and returns a list of 3 movesList objects
 // the first movesList is for the moves that have highest priority (would complete
 // a square for the player.
 // the second movesList is for the moves that have medium priority (relatively neutral
 // moves
 // the third movesList is for moves that are notably bad (would create 3 out of
 // four sides of a square, thus allowing the next player to complete a square
 bool moveTaken(int x, int y);
 void placeMove(int x, int y, Player *p);
 bool checkFour(int x, int y);
 //This method checks to see if adding the character v to the cell x,y in the board will complete a square, and, if
 // so, returns true
 //In the regular, this will result in the score of player[turn] going up by one and player[turn]'s character being
 //added to the board at x,y
 //In the Extra Credit, (this will lead to findMoves adding this cell to the MovesList object (e.g.,
 //allMovesls[0].potentialMoves[allMovesls.numMoves].resetCell(x,y,v);

 void getWinner();
 // When the board is full, this method finds which player has the highest score, and is thus the winner
 bool checkUpLeft(int x,int y);
 bool checkDownLeft(int x, int y);
 bool checkUpRight(int x, int y);
 bool checkDownRight(int x, int y);

 /************* This method is only necessary for the AI Extra Credit *******************/
 //bool checkThree(int x, int y);
 //This method checks to see if adding the character v to the cell x,y in the board will create 3/4 of a square, and, if
 // so, returns true (this will lead to findMoves adding this cell to the MovesList object (e.g.,
 //allMovesls[2].potentialMoves[allMovesls.numMoves].resetCell(x,y,v);
